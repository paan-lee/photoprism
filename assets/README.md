# Digital Asset Rights

(a) We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Digital Assets separately accompanying the software, embedded in the documentation, or provided for download — such as icons, fonts, illustrations, graphics, wallpapers, videos, sounds, models, and sample files („Digital Assets“) — as part of the Official Software Distribution, unless otherwise noted.

(b) Because some Digital Assets are licensed to us only for direct distribution, we cannot redistribute them under a more permissive license for other purposes. If the author or copyright holder has not released them under a permissive license, you must obtain a license before using them in your own work, whether commercial or non-commercial in nature.

(c) Our [documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/) is available under the terms of the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License](https://docs.photoprism.app/license/documentation/). Other terms may apply to Digital Assets — in particular illustrations, graphics, and videos — embedded in the documentation if they are licensed solely for direct distribution to us. When in doubt, please ask before distributing or using them for other works.

(d) PhotoPrism’s Brand Assets — including trademarks, logos, icons, custom fonts, corporate design, product and service names, and any other brand features and elements, whether registered or unregistered („Brand Assets“) — are proprietary assets owned exclusively by Michael Mayer and his legal successors („PhotoPrism“).

(e) Third parties, including licensees, may never claim ownership of PhotoPrism's Brand Assets or brands confusingly similar to PhotoPrism's Brand Assets in any way, including, without limitation, as a trademark, service mark, company name or designation, domain name, social media profile/handle, or in any other manner.

## Trademark and Brand Guidelines ##

You may not include the PhotoPrism® trademark in the name of your app, product or service, whether commercial or non-commercial in nature. This includes online services such as e-commerce, community, blog, information, advertising, and personal home pages, as well as apps, client apps, or third-party apps that interact with PhotoPrism.

Our guidelines, which may be updated from time to time, describe how our Brand Assets may be used. It is important to us that any permitted use of our Brand Assets is fair and meets the highest standards. To ensure this, we reserve the right to object to any use or misuse in any jurisdiction worldwide.

## Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability ##

OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND DIGITAL ASSETS ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDINARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES RELATING TO LOST DATA OR LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with our software and services, unless a warranty or assumption of liability was provided in return for a fee.

## Severability ##

(a) In the event that any provision set forth above is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be impaired, affected or invalidated in any way.

(b) It is hereby agreed and declared that it is the intention of the parties to enforce the remaining provisions without the inclusion of those provisions that may subsequently be declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.
