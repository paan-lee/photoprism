TERMS OF USE

  (a) We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
Digital Assets accompanying the software, embedded in the documentation,
or provided for download — such as icons, fonts, illustrations, graphics,
wallpapers, videos, sounds, models, and sample files („Digital Assets“) —
as part of the Official Software Distribution, unless otherwise noted.

  (b) Because some Digital Assets are licensed to us solely for direct
distribution, we cannot redistribute them under a more permissive license
for other purposes. If the author or copyright holder has not released them
under a permissive license, you must obtain a license before using them in
your own work, whether commercial or non-commercial in nature.

  (c) Related documentation is available under the terms of the CC BY-NC-SA
4.0 License, see <https://docs.photoprism.app/license/docs>. Other terms may
apply to Digital Assets — in particular illustrations, graphics, and videos
— embedded in the documentation if they are licensed to us solely for direct
distribution. When in doubt, please ask before distributing or using
them for other works.

TRADEMARK AND BRAND ASSETS

  (a) PhotoPrism’s Brand Assets — including trademarks, logos, icons, fonts,
corporate design, product and service names, and any other brand features
and elements, whether registered or unregistered („Brand Assets“) — are
proprietary assets owned exclusively by Michael Mayer and his legal successors
(„PhotoPrism“). We reserve the right to object to any use or misuse in any
jurisdiction worldwide. Visit <https://photoprism.app/trademark> to learn more.

  (b) Contributors, licensees, business partners, and other third parties
may never claim ownership of PhotoPrism's Brand Assets or brands confusingly
similar to PhotoPrism's Brand Assets in any way, including, without
limitation, as a trademark, service mark, company name or designation,
domain name, social media profile/handle, or in any other manner.

  (c) You may not include the PhotoPrism trademark in the name of your app,
product, or service, whether commercial or non-commercial in nature. This
includes online services such as e-commerce, community, blog, information,
advertising, and personal home pages, as well as apps, app stores, client
apps, or third-party apps that interact with PhotoPrism.

  (d) In the event that any provision is found to be unenforceable by a court
or other competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions hereof shall remain
in full force and effect.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

  OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND DIGITAL ASSETS ARE PROVIDED
“AS-IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOFTWARE AND
SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDINARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES
RELATING TO LOST DATA OR LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of
all civil liability in connection with our software and services, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability was provided in return for a fee.
