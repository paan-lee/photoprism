**Which software versions do you use?**

- PhotoPrism Architecture & Build Number (AMD64, ARM64, ARMv7,...)
- Database Type & Version (MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite,...)
- Operating System Types & Versions (Linux, Windows, Android,...)

IMPORTANT:
1. Always provide database and operating system details if it is a Backend, Import, or Indexing issue.
2. Always provide web browser and operating system details if it is a Frontend issue.
3. If it is a Performance problem, you must provide ALL information.

**On what kind of device is PhotoPrism installed?**

This is especially important if you are reporting a Performance, Import, or Indexing problem. You can skip this if you are reporting a problem found on our public demo, or if it is a completely unrelated issue, such as a broken page layout.

- Device / Processor Type (Raspberry Pi 4, Intel Core i7-3770, AMD Ryzen 7 3800X,...)
- Physical Memory & Swap Space (in GB)
- Storage Type (HDD, SSD, RAID, USB, Network Storage,...) 
- anything else that might be helpful

IMPORTANT: Always provide device, memory, and storage details when you have a Backend, Performance, Import, or Indexing issue.

**Do you use a Reverse Proxy, Firewall, VPN, or CDN?**

If yes, please specify type and version. You can skip this if you are reporting a completely unrelated issue.

IMPORTANT:
1. Always provide this information when you have a Reliability, Performance, or Frontend problem, such as failed uploads, connection errors, broken thumbnails, or video playback issues.
2. If you are using NGINX, also provide its configuration and/or consider asking the NGINX community for advice as we do not specialize in supporting their product: https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/proxies/nginx/
