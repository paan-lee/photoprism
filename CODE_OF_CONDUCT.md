# Code of Conduct

## Rules ##

To keep it simple, we only have three basic rules:

1. Don't panic
2. Don't be evil
3. Donâ€™t feed the trolls

## Examples ##

The following non-exhaustive list provides specific guidelines and examples:

- Don't ask for deadlines
- Don't be afraid to ask other silly questions
- Don't feel entitled to free support, advice, or features if you are not a contributor, sponsor, or paying customer
- If you have a general question, don't use GitHub Issues
- If you need technical support, don't use GitHub Issues
- If you are not sure, don't use GitHub Issues
- If you are having a bad day and want to offend someone, please go somewhere else

## Enforcement and Reporting ##

Any violation may be punished with a snarky comment and finally a "plonk",
which means that we ignore you according to rule #3.

We encourage all community members to resolve problems on their own whenever 
possible. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior 
may be [reported](https://photoprism.app/contact) to us.
