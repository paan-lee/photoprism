# PhotoPrism® Code of Conduct

By using the software and services we provide, you agree to our [Terms of Service](https://photoprism.app/terms), including our [Privacy Policy](https://photoprism.app/privacy) and the following Code of Conduct. It explains the "dos and don’ts" when interacting with other community members.

*Last Updated: April 27, 2022*

## Rules

Because we want our Code of Conduct to be easy to understand and implement, we have only three basic rules:

(1) Don't panic.

(2) Don't be evil.

(3) Don’t feed the trolls.

## Examples

The following non-exhaustive list provides specific guidelines and examples:

(a) Be respectful, be responsible, be kind, avoid asking for [deadlines](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/code-quality/#go-slow-before-you-go-fast).

(b) Do not feel entitled to free software, support, or advice if you are **not** a [contributor](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/), [sponsor](https://docs.photoprism.app/funding/), or paying customer.

(c) If you have a general question or need help installing our software, do **not** use GitHub Issues. You can [join us on Reddit](https://link.photoprism.app/reddit), ask in our [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat), or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) instead.

(d) We kindly ask you not to report bugs unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported problem that must be fixed directly in the app. [Read the docs](https://docs.photoprism.app) and [determine the cause of your problem](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) before opening an issue or starting a social media "shitstorm".

(e) If you are having a bad day and want to offend someone, please go somewhere else.

## Reporting

We encourage all community members to resolve problems on their own whenever possible. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior [may be reported](https://photoprism.app/contact) to us.

## Enforcement

(a) Violations may be punished with a [snarky](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/snarky) comment and finally a "Plonk", which means that we ignore you according to (3).

(b) Plonk stands for the metaphorical sound of a user hitting the bottom of the kill file. It was first used in [Usenet forums](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Plonk_(Usenet)), a precursor to the Web.
