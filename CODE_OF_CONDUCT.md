# Code of Conduct

## Rules ##
<img align="right" width="25%" src="https://da.photoprism.app/no-trolling/original.svg">

To keep it simple, we only have three basic rules:

1. Don't panic
2. Don't be evil
3. Donâ€™t feed the trolls

## Examples ##

The following non-exhaustive list provides specific guidelines and examples:

- be respectful, be responsible, be kind
- avoid asking for [deadlines](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/code-quality/#go-slow-before-you-go-fast)
- don't feel entitled to free support, advice, or features if you are not a [contributor](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/), [sponsor](https://docs.photoprism.app/funding/), or paying customer
- before reporting a bug, try to [determine the cause of your problem](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/)
- if you have a [general question](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions) or need [technical support](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/#getting-support), don't use GitHub Issues
- if you are having a bad day and want to offend someone, please go somewhere else

## Reporting ## 

We encourage all community members to resolve problems on their own whenever possible. Instances of abusive, 
harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be [reported](https://photoprism.app/contact) to us.

## Enforcement ## 

Any violation may be punished with a snarky comment and finally a "plonk", which means that we ignore you 
according to rule #3.
