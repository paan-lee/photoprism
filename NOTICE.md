		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

		2\. License Grants and Conditions
		--------------------------------
		
		2.1. Grants
		
		Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
		non-exclusive license:
		
		(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
		    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
		    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
		    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
		    as part of a Larger Work; and
		
		(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
		    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
		    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
		
		2.2. Effective Date
		
		The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
		become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
		distributes such Contribution.
		
		2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
		
		The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
		this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
		distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
		Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
		Contributor:
		
		(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
		    or
		
		(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
		    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
		    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
		    Version); or
		
		(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
		    its Contributions.
		
		This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
		or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
		the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
		
		2.4. Subsequent Licenses
		
		No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
		distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
		License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
		permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
		
		2.5. Representation
		
		Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
		Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
		to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
		
		2.6. Fair Use
		
		This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
		applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
		equivalents.
		
		2.7. Conditions
		
		Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
		in Section 2.1.
		
		3\. Responsibilities
		-------------------
		
		3.1. Distribution of Source Form
		
		All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
		Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
		the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
		Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
		License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
		attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
		Form.
		
		3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
		
		If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
		
		(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
		    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
		    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
		    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
		    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
		
		(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
		    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
		    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
		    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
		
		3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
		
		You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
		provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
		the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
		Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
		Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
		License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
		under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
		the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
		Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
		License(s).
		
		3.4. Notices
		
		You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
		(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
		or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
		the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
		the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
		
		3.5. Application of Additional Terms
		
		You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
		Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
		behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
		such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
		You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
		liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
		disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
		jurisdiction.
		
		4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
		---------------------------------------------------
		
		If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
		License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
		statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
		the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
		describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
		be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
		Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
		or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
		recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
		
		5\. Termination
		--------------
		
		5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
		if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
		compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
		Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
		ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
		non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
		come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
		notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
		first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
		from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
		Your receipt of the notice.
		
		5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
		infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
		counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
		directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
		You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
		2.1 of this License shall terminate.
		
		5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
		end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
		have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
		prior to termination shall survive termination.

		\*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
		\*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
		\*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
		\*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
		\*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
		\*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
		\*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
		\*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
		\*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *

		\*                                                                      *

		8\. Litigation
		-------------
		
		Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
		courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
		place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
		jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
		Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
		cross-claims or counter-claims.
		
		9\. Miscellaneous
		----------------
		
		This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
		matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
		unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
		necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
		that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
		shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
		
		10\. Versions of the License
		---------------------------
		
		10.1. New Versions
		
		Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
		10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
		publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
		distinguishing version number.
		
		10.2. Effect of New Versions
		
		You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
		of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
		or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
		steward.
		
		10.3. Modified Versions
		
		If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
		create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
		modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
		any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
		such modified license differs from this License).
		
		10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
		Licenses
		
		If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
		Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
		notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
		      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

#### **postcss-preset-env (6.7.0)**


* Declared License(s)
    * CC0-1.0
        * Attribution:
        \# CC0 1.0 Universal
		
		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
		COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
		COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
		AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
		
		BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
		TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
		BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
		CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
		CONDITIONS.
		
		1\. Definitions
		
		 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
		    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
		    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
		    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
		    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
		    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
		    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
		    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
		    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
		    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
		    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
		    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
		 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
		    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
		    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
		    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
		    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
		    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
		    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
		    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
		    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
		    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
		    License.
		 c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
		    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
		    other transfer of ownership.
		 d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
		    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
		 e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
		    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
		    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
		    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
		    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
		    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
		    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
		    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
		    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
		    organization that transmits the broadcast.
		 f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
		    of this License including without limitation any production in the
		    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
		    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
		    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
		    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
		    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
		    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
		    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
		    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
		    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
		    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
		    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
		    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
		    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
		    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
		    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
		    considered a literary or artistic work.
		 g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
		    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
		    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
		    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
		    violation.
		 h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
		    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
		    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
		    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
		    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
		    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
		    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
		    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
		    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
		    sounds or images.
		 i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
		    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
		    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
		    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
		    medium.
		
		2\. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
		limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
		limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
		copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
		
		3\. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
		Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
		perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
		exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
		
		 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
		    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
		    Collections;
		 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
		    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
		    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
		    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
		    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
		    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
		 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
		    in Collections; and,
		 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
		 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
		
		     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
		        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
		        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
		        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
		        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
		    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
		        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
		        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
		        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
		        of the rights granted under this License; and,
		   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
		        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
		        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
		        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
		        by You of the rights granted under this License.
		
		The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
		known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
		such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
		other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
		granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
		
		4\. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
		subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
		
		 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
		    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
		    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
		    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
		    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
		    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
		    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
		    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
		    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
		    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
		    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
		    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
		    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
		    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
		    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
		    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
		    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
		    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
		    as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
		    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
		    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
		    Section 4(b), as requested.
		 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
		    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
		    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
		    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
		    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
		    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
		    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
		    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
		    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
		    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
		    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
		    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
		    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
		    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
		    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
		    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
		    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
		    this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
		    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
		    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
		    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
		    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
		    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
		    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
		    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
		    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
		    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
		    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
		    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
		    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
		    Parties.
		 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
		    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
		    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
		    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
		    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
		    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
		    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
		    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
		    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
		    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
		    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
		    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
		    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
		    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
		    but not otherwise.
		
		5\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
		
		UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
		OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
		KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
		INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
		FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
		LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
		WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
		OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
		
		6\. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
		LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
		ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
		ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
		BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
		
		7\. Termination
		
		 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
		    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
		    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
		    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
		    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
		    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
		    survive any termination of this License.
		 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
		    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
		    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
		    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
		    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
		    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
		    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
		    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
		    stated above.
		
		8\. Miscellaneous
		
		 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
		    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
		    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
		 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
		    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
		    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
		 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
		    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
		    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
		    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
		    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
		    enforceable.
		 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
		    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
		    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
		 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
		    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
		    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
		    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
		    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
		    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
		 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
		    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
		    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
		    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
		    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
		    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
		    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
		    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
		    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
		    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
		    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
		    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
		    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
		    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
		    applicable law.
		
		
		Creative Commons Notice
		
		    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty

		    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
		    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
		    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
		    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

		     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
		     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
		     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
		     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
		     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
		     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
		     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
		     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
		     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
		     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
		     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
		     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
		     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
		     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

		By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
		to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
		Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
		extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
		granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
		these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
		consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
		Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
		
		
		Section 1 -- Definitions.
		
		  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
		     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
		     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
		     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
		     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
		     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
		     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
		     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
		     synched in timed relation with a moving image.
		
		  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
		     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
		     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
		
		  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
		     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
		     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
		     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
		     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
		     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
		     Rights.
		
		  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
		     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
		     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
		     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
		     agreements.
		
		  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
		     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
		     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
		
		  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
		     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
		     License.
		
		  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
		     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
		     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
		     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
		
		  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
		     under this Public License.
		
		  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
		     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
		     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
		     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
		     available to the public including in ways that members of the
		     public may access the material from a place and at a time
		     individually chosen by them.
		
		  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
		     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
		     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
		     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
		     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
		
		  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
		     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
		
		
		Section 2 -- Scope.
		
		  a. License grant.
		
		       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
		          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
		          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
		          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
		
		            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
		               in part; and
		
		            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
		
		       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
		          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
		          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
		          its terms and conditions.
		
		       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
		          6(a).
		
		       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
		          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
		          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
		          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
		          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
		          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
		          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
		          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
		          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
		          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
		          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
		
		       5. Downstream recipients.
		
		            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
		               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
		               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
		               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
		               Public License.
		
		            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
		               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
		               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
		               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
		               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
		               Material.
		
		       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
		          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
		          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
		          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
		          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
		          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
		
		  b. Other rights.
		
		       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
		          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
		          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
		          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
		          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
		          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
		          Rights, but not otherwise.
		
		       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
		          Public License.
		
		       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
		          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
		          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
		          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
		          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
		          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
		
		
		Section 3 -- License Conditions.
		
		Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
		following conditions.
		
		  a. Attribution.
		
		       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
		          form), You must:
		
		            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
		               with the Licensed Material:
		
		                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
		                    Material and any others designated to receive
		                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
		                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
		                    designated);
		
		                ii. a copyright notice;
		
		               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
		
		                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
		                    warranties;
		
		                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
		                    extent reasonably practicable;
		
		            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
		               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
		
		            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
		               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
		               hyperlink to, this Public License.
		
		       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
		          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
		          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
		          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
		          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
		          information.
		
		       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
		          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
		          reasonably practicable.
		
		       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
		          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
		          Material from complying with this Public License.
		
		
		Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
		
		Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
		apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
		
		  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
		     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
		     portion of the contents of the database;
		
		  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
		     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
		     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
		     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
		
		  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
		     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
		
		For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
		replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
		Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
		
		
		Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
		
		  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
		     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
		     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
		     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
		     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
		     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
		     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
		     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
		     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
		     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
		
		  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
		     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
		     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
		     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
		     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
		     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
		     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
		     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
		     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
		
		  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
		     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
		     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
		     waiver of all liability.
		
		
		Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
		
		  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
		     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
		     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
		     terminate automatically.
		
		  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
		     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
		
		       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
		          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
		          violation; or
		
		       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
		
		     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
		     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
		     of this Public License.
		
		  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
		     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
		     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
		     will not terminate this Public License.
		
		  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
		     License.
		
		
		Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
		
		  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
		     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
		
		  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
		     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
		     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
		
		
		Section 8 -- Interpretation.
		
		  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
		     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
		     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
		     be made without permission under this Public License.
		
		  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
		     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
		     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
		     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
		     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
		     conditions.
		
		  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
		     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
		     Licensor.
		
		  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
		     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
		     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
		     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

* Declared License(s)
    * CC0-1.0
        * Attribution:
        \# CC0 1.0 Universal
		
		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

		  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		  "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		  exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		  source, and configuration files.
		
		  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		  and conversions to other media types.
		
		  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

		  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

		  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		  subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		2\. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		  as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		  meet the following conditions:
		
		  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		      stating that You changed the files; and
		
		  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		      the Derivative Works; and
		
		  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		      as modifying the License.
		
		  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		  the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

		                           Version 2.0, January 2004
		                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
		
		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
		
		      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
		      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
		      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
		      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
		      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
		      identification within third-party archives.

		2\. License Grants and Conditions
		--------------------------------
		
		2.1. Grants
		
		Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
		non-exclusive license:
		
		(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
		    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
		    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
		    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
		    as part of a Larger Work; and
		
		(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
		    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
		    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
		
		2.2. Effective Date
		
		The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
		become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
		distributes such Contribution.
		
		2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
		
		The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
		this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
		distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
		Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
		Contributor:
		
		(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
		    or
		
		(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
		    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
		    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
		    Version); or
		
		(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
		    its Contributions.
		
		This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
		or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
		the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
		
		2.4. Subsequent Licenses
		
		No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
		distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
		License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
		permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
		
		2.5. Representation
		
		Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
		Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
		to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
		
		2.6. Fair Use
		
		This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
		applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
		equivalents.
		
		2.7. Conditions
		
		Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
		in Section 2.1.
		
		3\. Responsibilities
		-------------------
		
		3.1. Distribution of Source Form
		
		All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
		Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
		the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
		Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
		License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
		attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
		Form.
		
		3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
		
		If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
		
		(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
		    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
		    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
		    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
		    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
		
		(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
		    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
		    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
		    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
		
		3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
		
		You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
		provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
		the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
		Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
		Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
		License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
		under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
		the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
		Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
		License(s).
		
		3.4. Notices
		
		You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
		(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
		or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
		the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
		the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
		
		3.5. Application of Additional Terms
		
		You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
		Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
		behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
		such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
		You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
		liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
		disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
		jurisdiction.
		
		4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
		---------------------------------------------------
		
		If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
		License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
		statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
		the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
		describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
		be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
		Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
		or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
		recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
		
		5\. Termination
		--------------
		
		5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
		if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
		compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
		Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
		ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
		non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
		come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
		notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
		first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
		from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
		Your receipt of the notice.
		
		5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
		infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
		counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
		directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
		You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
		2.1 of this License shall terminate.

		         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
		         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
		         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

		      2.4. Subsequent Licenses

		      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
		      2.6. Fair Use
		      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
		      2.7. Conditions
		      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
		   3. Responsibilities
		      3.1. Distribution of Source Form
		      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.
		      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
		      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
		         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
		         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
		      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
		      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
		      3.4. Notices
		      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
		      3.5. Application of Additional Terms
		      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
		   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
		   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
		   5. Termination
		      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
		      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
		      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
		   6. Disclaimer of Warranty
		   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
		   7. Limitation of Liability
		   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
		   8. Litigation
		   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
		   9. Miscellaneous
		   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

		      10.3. Modified Versions
		      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
		      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

		the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
		Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
		License(s).
		
		3.4. Notices
		
		You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
		(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
		or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
		the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
		the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
		
		3.5. Application of Additional Terms
		
		You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
		Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
		behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
		such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
		You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
		liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
		indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
		disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
		jurisdiction.
		
		4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
		---------------------------------------------------
		
		If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
		License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
		statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
		the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
		describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
		be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
		Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
		or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
		recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
		
		5\. Termination
		--------------
		
		5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
		if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
		compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
		Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
		ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
		non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
		come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
		notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
		first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
		from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
		Your receipt of the notice.
		
		5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
		infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
		counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
		directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
		You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
		2.1 of this License shall terminate.
		
		5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
		end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
		have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
		prior to termination shall survive termination.

		\*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
		\*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
		\*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
		\*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
		\*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
		\*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
		\*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
		\*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
		\*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
		\*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
		\*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
		\*                                                                      *

		\*  --------------------------                                          *

		\*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
		\*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
		\*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

		\*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

		\*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
		\*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
		\*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

		\*                                                                      *
		************************************************************************
		
		8\. Litigation
		-------------
		
		Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
		courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
		place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
		jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
		Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
		cross-claims or counter-claims.
		
		9\. Miscellaneous
		----------------
		
		This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
		matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
		unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
		necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
		that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
		shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
		
		10\. Versions of the License
		---------------------------
		
		10.1. New Versions
		
		Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
		10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
		publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
		distinguishing version number.
		
		10.2. Effect of New Versions
		
		You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
		of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
		or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
		steward.
		
		10.3. Modified Versions
		
		If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
		create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
		modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
		any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
		such modified license differs from this License).

* Declared License(s)
    * CC0-1.0
        * Attribution:
        \# CC0 1.0 Universal
		
		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

* Declared License(s)
    * CC0-1.0
        * Attribution:
        \# CC0 1.0 Universal
		
		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,

* Declared License(s)
    * CC0-1.0
        * Attribution:
        \# CC0 1.0 Universal
		
		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

    * CC0-1.0

        \# CC0 1.0 Universal
		
		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

		\## Statement of Purpose
		
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
		exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
		subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
		authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
		
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
		purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
		(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
		infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
		redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
		including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
		to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
		production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
		greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
		others.
		
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
		additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
		Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
		and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
		publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
		Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
		effect of CC0 on those rights.
		
		1\. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
		   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
		   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
		   to, the following:
		   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
		      and translate a Work;
		   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
		      depicted in a Work;
		   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
		      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
		   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
		      a Work;
		   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
		      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
		      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
		      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
		      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
		      thereof.
		
		2\. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
		   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
		   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
		   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
		   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
		   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
		   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
		   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
		   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
		   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
		   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
		   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
		   Statement of Purpose.
		
		3\. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
		   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
		   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
		   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
		   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
		   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
		   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
		   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
		   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
		   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
		   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
		   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
		   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
		   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
		   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
		   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
		   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
		   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
		   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
		   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
		
		4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
		      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
		      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
		      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
		      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
		      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
		      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
		      extent permissible under applicable law.
		   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
		      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
		      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
		      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
		      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
		      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
		      CC0 or use of the Work.

		    exercising permissions granted by this License.

		    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		    source, and configuration files.
		
		    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		    and conversions to other media types.
		
		    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

		    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		    as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		    meet the following conditions:
		
		    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		        stating that You changed the files; and
		
		    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		        the Derivative Works; and
		
		    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		        as modifying the License.
		
		    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		    the conditions stated in this License.
		
		 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
		License<<endOptional>>
		THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
		BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
		   1. Definitions
		      a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
		      b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
		      c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
		      d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
		      e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
		      f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
		      g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
		      h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
		      i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
		   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
		   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
		      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
		      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
		      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
		      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
		      e. For the avoidance of doubt:
		         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
		         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
		         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
		   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
		   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
		      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
		      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
		      c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
		   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
		   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
		   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
		   7. Termination
		      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
		      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
		   8. Miscellaneous
		      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
		      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
		      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
		      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.
		      e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
		      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
		Creative Commons Notice
		Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

    * CC0-1.0

        CC0 1.0 Universal<<endOptional>>
		Statement of Purpose
		The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
		Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
		For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
		   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
		      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
		      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
		      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
		      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
		      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
		      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
		      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
		   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
		   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
		   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
		      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
		      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
		      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
		      d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
		
		You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		                           Version 2.0, January 2004
		                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
		
		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

		TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		1\. Definitions.
		
		   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		   the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		   exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		   source, and configuration files.
		
		   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		   and conversions to other media types.
		
		   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		2\. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		   as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		   meet the following conditions:
		
		   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		       stating that You changed the files; and
		
		   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		       the Derivative Works; and
		
		   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		       as modifying the License.
		
		   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		   the conditions stated in this License.
		
		5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
		
		      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
