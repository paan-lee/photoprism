# Every Contribution Makes a Difference

We welcome contributions of any kind, including blog posts, tutorials, testing, writing documentation, and pull requests. Our [Developer Guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/) contains all the information necessary for you to get started.

## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, or an issue has not
(yet) been clearly identified:

- You are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat)
- or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions

### GitHub Issues ###

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in [our source code](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism). Thank you for your careful consideration!

- When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and other information about your environment such as [browser, browser plugins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory), and [processor](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu)
- Note that all issue **subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub for each new comment, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for personal discussions/questions
- [Contact us](https://photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives our team the opportunity to [improve the docs](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support to you, instead of handling unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by responding to comments

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Because we want to create the best possible product for our users, we have a [set of criteria](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/pull-requests#acceptance-criteria) to ensure that all submissions are acceptable.

Follow our [step-by-step guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/pull-requests#how-to-create-and-submit-a-pull-request) to learn how to submit
new features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements. Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions.

**Reviewing, testing and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources on our side. If it's not just a small fix, it can take several months.**

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA) ###

After submitting your first pull request, you will automatically be asked to [accept our CLA](https://link.photoprism.app/cla):

- this gives us the ability to [(re-)license all code and documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_relicensing) at any time, *almost* as if we had created it ourselves (you retain the rights to your own work, which may be different for other CLAs)
- otherwise, we cannot accept pull requests, as this would mean that we are not able to change the license of our software and documentation at a later time, even though most of it was developed and written by us
- this may be necessary, for example, if the license is incompatible with a larger combined work, we want to remove some restrictions on the AGPL/Creative Commons license, or it turns out that someone is abusing the existing license in a way we don't yet know about
- the lack of a formal contract [would also lead to legal uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO%E2%80%93Linux_disputes) for us and all users, as some contributors could later claim that they did not intend to license their code in any way and that it was stolen
