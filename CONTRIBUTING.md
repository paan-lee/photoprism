# Every Contribution Makes a Difference

[We welcome contributions of any kind, including blog posts, tutorials, testing, writing documentation, and pull requests.](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/)

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photoprism_app) and join the [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
to get regular updates, connect with other contributors, and discuss your ideas.
Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) explains the "dos and don’ts."

An important part of our journey is to explore new ways in product development and build better software through simplicity and consistent use of community feedback. Feel free to [share your thoughts](https://photoprism.app/contact) with us at any time.

## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, or an issue has not
(yet) been clearly identified:

- you are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
- or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions)

### GitHub Issues ###

Don't report a bug unless you are sure you found a new problem that must be fixed directly in the app:

- Ask for [technical support](https://photoprism.app/contact) if you need help, it could be a local configuration issue, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives our team the opportunity to [improve the documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support to you, instead of handling incomplete and/or duplicate bug reports
- When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and other information about your environment such as [browser, browser plugins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, storage type, memory size, and processor

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

[Because we want to create the best possible product for our users, we have a set of guidelines to ensure that all source code submissions are acceptable.](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/pull-requests)
They include step-by-step instructions for submitting new features,
bug fixes, and documentation improvements.
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions.

**Reviewing, testing and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources
on our side. If it's not just a small fix, it can take several months.**
