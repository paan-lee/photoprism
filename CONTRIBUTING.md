## Submitting Pull Requests ##

[Because we want to create the best possible product for our users, we have a set of guidelines to ensure that all source code submissions are acceptable.](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/pull-requests)
They include step-by-step instructions for submitting new features,
bug fixes, and documentation improvements.
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) /
