Let's join forces
=================

We've [built similar apps more than once](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Mediencenter) and every single time the constraints of working in a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment. We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget.
That doesn't mean we can or want to cover all expenses from our personal savings while millions are wasted in commercial software projects every day.

This is your chance to spend a small amount for something truly useful.
Your contribution will have significant impact on our progress. Thank you very much! ðŸ’Ž

You can conveniently [donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism), [become a sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) or [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) to discuss further details.

Community feedback and [full transparency](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Project-Status) are extremely important to us. Please [let us know](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you have any questions.
