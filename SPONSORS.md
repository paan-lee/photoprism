Let's join forces
=================

Developing open-source software is a community effort. Solid funding enables us to quickly implement features and integrate with services you care about.

Grants and donations will be used for [organizing meetups](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Meetups), [running our servers](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Infrastructure), visiting conferences, buying test devices, offering perks for contributions, and covering our cost of living.

We've [built similar apps more than once](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Mediencenter) and every single time the constraints of working in a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment. We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget.

That doesn't mean we can or want to cover all expenses from our personal savings while millions are wasted in commercial software projects every day. This is your chance to spend a small amount for something truly useful and get a lot of love for it in return.

**Your support is highly appreciated and will have significant impact on our work.**

You can conveniently [donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism), [become a sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) or [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) to discuss further details.

Community feedback and [full transparency](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Project-Status) are extremely important to us. Please [let us know](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) if you have any questions.
