Let's join forces
=================

You're welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero), 
especially if you have feature requests or need help with using our software.

In addition, you can find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/browseyourlife). 
Our [sponsors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) and 
[contributors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/graphs/contributors/) will get for free whatever we might 
have to charge for a geodata subscription and/or additional features later.
If we manage to find enough sponsors backing our project, we can keep all features free for everyone!

Also, please [leave a star](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/stargazers) on GitHub if you like this project. 
It provides additional motivation to keep going.

Ideas backed by a sponsor are marked with a golden [sponsor][issues:sponsor] label.
Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded][issues:unfunded].

Thank you very much to all of our sponsors and donors (including those that want to stay private)!
