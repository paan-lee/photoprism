Let's join forces
=================

Developing open-source software is a community effort. Solid funding
enables us to quickly implement features and integrate with services
you care about.

Grants and donations will be used for organizing meetups, visiting
conferences, buying test devices, offering perks for contributions,
and covering our cost of living.

We've built similar apps more than once and every single time the
constraints of working in a profit-oriented corporate environment were
an impediment. We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the
budget. However, we can't cover all expenses from our personal savings.

Your support is highly appreciated and will have significant impact on
[our progress](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Project-Status).

Please visit our new [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism)
page or [reach out](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) to us if you work for
an organization that would like to sponsor our project.
