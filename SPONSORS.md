Let's join forces
=================

Millions are wasted in commercial software projects every day. 
This is a chance to spend a modest amount for [something truly useful](https://dl.photoprism.org/slides/PhotoPrism.pdf).
We know we can do it because we've [done it before](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Mediencenter). 
Your support will have significant impact on our [progress](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Project-Status).

You can [become a sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism), [fund issues](https://issuehunt.io/repos/119160553), [donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism) or [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) to discuss further details.
Thank you very much! ðŸ’Ž
