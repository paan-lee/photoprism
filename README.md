PhotoPrism¬Æ is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud!

## Key Features ##

* Our clearly structured user interface makes organizing and sharing your personal photo collection as easy as 
  it should be ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
* Import everything without worrying about duplicates or [RAW to JPEG conversion](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/library/converting/).
* Automatic image classification based on Google TensorFlow. In addition, our indexer detects colors, 
  chroma, luminance, projection, location type, quality, and many other properties.
* Includes four high-resolution world maps to see where you've been and for rediscovering 
  long-forgotten shots.
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, can connect directly to 
  PhotoPrism so that you to can open, edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local. 
  You may easily sync your pictures with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) as well.  
* PhotoPrism feels like a native app and, of course, you can also add it to your home screen.

## Try PhotoPrism ##

You're welcome to play with our public demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org).

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step installation instructions can be found on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/) - 
all you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

Next, you'll have to [index](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/library/import-vs-index/) 
your library. Please be patient, this will take a while depending on the size of your photo collection.

Already indexed photos can be browsed in [Photos](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/organize/browse/)
while videos show up in [Videos](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/organize/video/).
Counts are continuously updated in the navigation.

If files are missing, they might be in [Review](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/organize/review/) due to low quality or missing metadata.
You can turn this and other features off in [Settings](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/settings/ui/), depending on
your specific use case.

We do our best to provide a complete, stable version very soon. Check the 
[roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) for open issues.

## Feature Requests ##

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, 
what needs testing, and which feature requests are going to be implemented next.

Please give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  , so that we know what is most popular.
Ideas backed by one or more [sponsors](SPONSORS.md) will be prioritized as well.

## Contributions ##

We welcome contributions of any kind. If you have a bug or an idea, read our 
[guide](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/) before opening an issue.
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) / 
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy) can be
good (first) contributions.

## Funding ##

This project is about freedom and privacy but not necessarily about free beer. We feel like it
would be a mistake to state there will be no costs, because clearly we have huge expenses, your server hardware
will have a price tag and then maybe you'd like to have some extra features that need to be developed.

It's fair to say that users with basic needs will have no monthly costs. We were also way more effective 
per dollar than investor-backed startups and learned a lot on top of it.
An earlier version of this document contained a rough number, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter.

Most established OSS companies make the bulk of their revenue with enterprise customers, that's why private users 
and single developers typically get everything for free. Obviously that doesn't work if you have only private users
that refuse to share their data on top of it.

Looking forward, specific solutions for funding development and maintenance could be to...

  - provide additional benefits to our sponsors
  - sell a tested & supported version in the app store while our contributors and other developers can 
    continue to use Docker or build from source
  - develop a one-click solution for private cloud hosting together with selected providers we trust
  - offer a geodata, public events, and maps subscription since OpenStreetMap doesn't want us to use their development 
    API for production, which is perfectly fine

## Donations ##

You're welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero), 
especially if you have feature requests or need help with using our software.

In addition, you can find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/browseyourlife). 
Our [sponsors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SPONSORS.md) and 
[contributors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/graphs/contributors/) will get for free whatever we might 
have to charge for a geodata subscription and/or additional features later.
If we manage to find enough sponsors backing our project, we can keep all features free for everyone!

Also, please [leave a star](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/stargazers) on GitHub if you like this project. 
It provides additional motivation to keep going.

Ideas backed by a sponsor are marked with a golden [sponsor](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) label.
Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

Thank you very much! <3
