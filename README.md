PhotoPrism¬Æ is a privately hosted app for browsing, organizing, and sharing your photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to uploading your visual memories to the cloud!

* Since the [user interface](https://demo.photoprism.org/) is a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
  it provides a native app-like experience, and you can easily install it on the home screen of all major operating systems and mobile devices
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots

* Use [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/) to securely backup iOS and Android mobile devices in the background

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. 
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Our [latest release](https://docs.photoprism.org/release-notes/) not only includes 
**facial recognition**, it also comes as a 
**single [multi-arch image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism) for AMD64, ARM64, and ARMv7**. 
That means you don't need to pull from different Docker repositories anymore.
We recommend updating your existing `docker-compose.yml` config based on 
[our examples](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/).
