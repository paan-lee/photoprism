We love taking photos. Privacy concerns - and the wish to properly archive them for the next generation - brought us to the
conclusion that existing cloud solutions are not the right tool to keep them organized.
At the same time, traditional desktop software like Adobe Lightroom lacks many features and can only be used on a single computer.
That's why we started working on an easy-to-use application that can be hosted at home or on a private server.

## What to expect

* Clearly structured Web interface for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
* Import everything without worrying about duplicates or RAW to JPEG conversion.
* Reverse geocoding and automated tagging based on Google TensorFlow.
* No monthly costs. No proprietary formats. No privacy concerns.

## For the early birds

You are welcome to get an impression and provide early feedback.
All you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) 
to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

Note that we just started working on the UI and features are neither complete or stable.
Step-by-step [instructions](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/setup/) can be found 
in our User Guide on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/). 
Developers can skip this and move on to the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki).

## Why this has to be free software

The development of every commercial product is focused on monetization.
We've built similar apps more than once and every single time the constraints of working
in a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment.
We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget. Simplicity can be very powerful.
Go, the programming language in which this software is written in, is a great example. It
was heavily influenced by the ideas of Niklaus Wirth.

> Simple, elegant solutions are more effective, but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable.
> â€” NIKLAUS WIRTH, COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM, FEB. 1985
