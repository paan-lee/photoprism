PhotoPrism is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud or pay monthly fees.

## What to expect

* Clearly structured Web interface for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
* Import everything without worrying about duplicates or RAW to JPEG conversion.
* Reverse geocoding and automated tagging based on Google TensorFlow.
* No monthly costs. No proprietary formats. No privacy concerns.

## For the early birds

You're welcome to play with our demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org).
Leave your email to get a [release notification](https://goo.gl/forms/KBPVGl9PCsOKrAv33).

Step-by-step [installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/setup/) can be found
in our [User Guide](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/).
Developers can skip this and move on to the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki).

All you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.
Note that we just [started working](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Project-Status) 
on the UI and features are neither complete nor stable. 
We plan to ship the final app as a single binary including all dependencies.

If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask in our [help forum](https://groups.google.com/a/photoprism.org/forum/#!forum/help) 
or [contact us via email](mailto:hello@photoprism.org).

## Why this has to be free software

The development of every commercial product is focused on monetization.
We've [built similar apps more than once](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Mediencenter) and every single time the constraints of working
in a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment.

We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - can be very powerful.
Go, the programming language we're using, is a [great example](https://dave.cheney.net/2015/03/08/simplicity-and-collaboration).

Our long-term goal is to become an open platform for machine learning [research](https://dl.photoprism.org/slides/Personal%20Photo%20Management%20and%20Preservation.pdf) based on real-world photo collections.

## How to contribute

Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) / 
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy) can be
good (first) contributions. Please join our 
[developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/photoprism.org/forum/#!forum/developers)

## Donations

We don't want to ask individuals for a donation at the moment. Please leave a star if you like this project, it provides enough motivation to keep going.
Thank you very much! <3

## Sponsorship

Developing open-source software is a [community effort](https://dl.photoprism.org/slides/PhotoPrism.pdf). Solid funding enables us to quickly implement features and integrate with services you care about.
Grants and donations will be used for [organizing meetups](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Meetups), [running our servers](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Infrastructure), visiting conferences, buying test devices, offering perks for contributions, and covering our cost of living.
