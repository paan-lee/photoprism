PhotoPrism¬Æ is an AI-powered app for browsing, organizing & sharing your photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way.
You can run it at home, on a private server, or in the cloud.

## Getting Started ##
<img align="right" width="25%" src="https://photoprism.app/user/pages/01.home/03._screenshots/iphone-maps-hybrid-540px.png">

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.app](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. 
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The [stable version](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) and development 
preview have been built into a single [multi-arch image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism) for 64-bit AMD, Intel,
and ARM processors. That means, [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/) 3 / 4 owners can pull 
from the same repository, enjoy the exact same functionality, and can follow the regular 
[installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/) 
after going through a short list of [requirements](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/).

Existing users are advised to update their `docker-compose.yml` config based on our examples
available at [dl.photoprism.app/docker](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/).

## Roadmap ##

Our vision is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible.
The [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, 
what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.
Please give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  , so that we know what is most popular.

Ideas endorsed by [silver, gold, and platinum sponsors](SPONSORS.md) receive a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor)
and will be prioritized on the [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5).

We have a zero bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions.
This comes at a price, as we can't give exact deadlines for new features.

Having said that, funding really has the highest impact. So users can do their part and
[become a sponsor](https://docs.photoprism.app/funding/) to get their favorite features as soon as possible.

## Questions?

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photoprism_app) or join our [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
to get regular updates, connect with other users, and discuss your ideas.
Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) explains the "dos and don‚Äôts."

## Contributions ##

We welcome contributions of any kind, including bug reports, testing, writing documentation, 
tutorials, blog posts, and pull requests.

The [Developer Guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/) contains all information
necessary to get you started.
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions.

Because we want to create the best possible product for our users,
we have a [set of guidelines](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/pull-requests)
to ensure that all source code submissions are acceptable.
They include step-by-step instructions for submitting new features,
bug fixes, and documentation improvements.

**Reviewing, testing and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources
on our side. If it's not just a small fix, it can take several months.**
