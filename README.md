PhotoPrism¬Æ is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud!

## Key Features ##

* Our clearly structured [user interface](https://demo.photoprism.org/) makes organizing and sharing your personal photo collection as easy as 
  it should be ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
* Index everything without worrying about duplicates or [RAW to JPEG conversion](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/library/converting/).
* Automatic [image classification](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/metadata/classification/) 
  based on Google TensorFlow. In addition, our indexer detects _colors_, _chroma_, _luminance_, _projection_, 
  _location type_, _quality_, and many other properties.
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been,
  and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots.
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, may 
  [connect](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/backup/webdav/) directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open, 
  edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local. 
  You may easily sync your pictures with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) as well.  
* PhotoPrism feels [like a native app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) and, 
  of course, you can also add it to your home screen.

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

## Funding ##

This project is about freedom and privacy but not necessarily about free beer. We feel like it
would be a mistake to state there will be no costs, because clearly we have huge expenses, your server hardware
will have a price tag and then maybe you'd like to have some extra features that need to be developed.

It's fair to say that users with basic needs will have no monthly costs. We were also way more effective 
per dollar than investor-backed startups and learned a lot on top of it.
An earlier version of this document contained a rough number, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter.

Most established OSS companies make the bulk of their revenue with enterprise customers, that's why private users 
and single developers typically get everything for free. Obviously that doesn't work if you have only private users
that refuse to share their data on top of it.

Looking forward, specific solutions for funding development and maintenance could be to...

  - provide additional benefits to our sponsors
  - sell a tested & supported version in the app store while our contributors and other developers can 
    continue to use Docker or build from source
  - develop a one-click solution for private cloud hosting together with selected providers we trust
  - offer a geodata, public events, and maps subscription since OpenStreetMap doesn't want us to use their development 
    API for production, which is perfectly fine
