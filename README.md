We love taking photos and they belong to our most valuable (and storage consuming) assets. Privacy concerns - and the wish to properly
archive them for the next generation - brought us to the conclusion that existing cloud solutions are not the right tool to keep them organized.
At the same time, traditional desktop software like Adobe Lightroom lacks many features and can only be used on a single computer.
That's why we started working on an easy-to-use application that can be hosted at home or on a private server.

Donations
---------

To continue working full-time and build a community, we are looking for public funding or a private sponsor who shares our vision. Any help and advice is much appreciated.

Since the software is not released yet, we don't want to ask for small donations from individuals. Please leave a star if you like this project, it provides enough motivation to keep going.
