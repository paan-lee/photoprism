# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Linux / AMD64)
#
# Note:
# - Use SQLite only for small libraries and testing. SQLite locks the index on updates, so other operations have to
#   wait. In the worst case, this can lead to timeout errors. MariaDB is optimized for high concurrency.
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), especially when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:

  ## App Server (required)

    ## Don't enable automatic restarts until PhotoPrism has been properly configured and tested!
    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:
