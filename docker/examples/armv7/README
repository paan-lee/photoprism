# Running PhotoPrism on ARMv7-based devices (32-bit)

You have to resort to alternative Docker images to run PhotoPrism and MariaDB on ARMv7-based devices
and those with a 32-bit operating system:

ARMv7 Release: photoprism/photoprism:armv7
MariaDB      : linuxserver/mariadb:latest

Pay close attention to changed directory and environment variable names.

If your device meets the system requirements, mostly the same installation instructions as for regular Linux
servers apply:

  https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/

### System Requirements ###

- Your device should have at least 4 GB of memory. Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space
  or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected restarts, especially when the indexer temporarily needs more
  memory to process large files.
- If you see Docker errors related to "cgroups", it may help to add the following to `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`:
  ```
  cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
  ```
- We recommend disabling Linux kernel security in your `docker-compose.yml`, especially if you do not have experience
  with the configuration:
  ```yaml
  photoprism:
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
      - apparmor:unconfined
  ```
- If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
  HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted in
  clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:
  https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/proxies/traefik/

!!! Note
    Indexing large photo and video collections significantly benefits from fast, local SSD storage,
    and plenty of memory for caching. Especially the conversion of RAW images and the transcoding of
    videos are very demanding.

!!! Reducing System Load
    If you're running out of memory - or other system resources - while indexing, try reducing the
    [number of workers](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/config-options/) by setting
    `PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS` to a reasonably small value in `docker-compose.yml` (depending on the performance of the server).
    As a measure of last resort, you may disable using TensorFlow for image classification and facial recognition.

### Getting Updates ###

If an old version is running on your device and is not updated, you may need to explicitly
pull the latest image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism).
Note that the `:latest` image tag does not cause Docker to automatically download new images.
